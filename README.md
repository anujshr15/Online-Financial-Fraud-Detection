# Online Financial Fraud Detection

## Title: Online financial fraud detection using machine learning 

## Objective: To perform a comprehensive study of different data preprocessing strategies in the financial domain

## Highlights of the project: 
A lot of focus on building better ML models however not much attention is given to preprocessing techniques involved. In our project, we focus on trying out different undersampling, oversampling , their combination as well as different feature selection algorithms. Weâ€™ll also apply different machine learning approaches on top of the features and the results will be compared using standard metrics.

We aim to perform the strategies on different datasets
1) European credit card transactions dataset - by Machine Learning group of University of Brussels
2) Synthetic dataset - A dataset generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator

### Undersampling techniques used -
1) Random Undersampling
2) Instance Hardness Threshold
3) Cluster centroid
4) Near miss
5) One sided selection
6) Tomek links

### Oversampling techniques used -
1) Random oversampling
2) SMOTE
3) ADASYN
4) Variations of SMOTE

### Combination of Undersampling and Oversampling - 
1) SMOTETomek

### Feature Selection techniques used - 
1) Removing correlated features
2) Information gain

### Machine Learning models used -
1) KNN
2) Logistic regression
3) Gaussian Naive Bayes
4) Decision Tree
5) Voting Classifier


### Metrics used - 
1) F1- Score

This project is in progress. More techniques will be added.
